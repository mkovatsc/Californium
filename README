Californium (Cf) CoAP framework in Java
=======================================

Californium is a Java CoAP implementation targeting back-end services.
Thus, the focus is on usability and features, not on resource-efficiency like
for embedded devices.

The Java implementation supports quick realization of servers and clients,
a HTTP-CoAP and vice versa ProxyEndpoint is currently under development.
